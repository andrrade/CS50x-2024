sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Reversed = 5,205s; Sorted = 0,736s; Random: 5,887s. (50000.txt)
Bubble Sort has a time complexity of O(n²) and Ω(n).
It was the fastest in the best case and the slowest in the worst case.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Reversed = 0,815s; Sorted = 0,822s; Random: 0,779s. (50000.txt)
Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) and Ω(n log n).
In all cases, it was very quick.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Reversed = 2,847s; Sorted = 2,704s; Random: 2,525s. (50000.txt)
Selection Sort has a time complexity of O(n²) and Ω(n²).
In all cases, it was slow.
